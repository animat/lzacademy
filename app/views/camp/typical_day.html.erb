<h1>A typical day at LZ Camp</h1>
<p>Make no mistake about it: LinguaZone Language Camp is a <em>camp</em>, and we sure do act like one! Our days are a balance of focus and fun, helping students accomplish an incredible amount without feeling like "summer school."</p>

<h2>8:15 - 8:30 Arriving</h2>
<p>Students arrive between 8:15 and 8:30 to settle in before the day officially begins.</p>

<h2>8:30 - 11:30 Mornings</h2>
<p>We delve into brand new topics every morning. Through our activity-based approach, students acquire new skills and build a strong vocabulary base, reaching toward greater proficiency in the target language.</p>

<h2>11:30 - 12:30 Multi-Lingual Lunch</h2>
<p>All students enjoy a brown bag lunch together, followed by language games. Some favorites include LinguaZone Scribblish, Late Worker, Taboo, and Human Memory Board, to name a few.</p>

<h2>12:30 - 2:30 Afternoons</h2>
<p>We slow the pace in the afternoons to practice all of the new material we learn in the mornings. This dedicated time gives us the opportunity to take on elaborate, long-term projects, develop new talents, and collaborate with other classes in games and competitions.</p>

<h2>2:30 Pick-up</h2>
<p>Students call it a day and head home at 2:30.</p>


<h1>A typical session</h1>
<p>Our younger campers, ages 4 - 10, join us for two weeks at a time. Older campers, ages 11 - 17, join us at camp for three weeks at a time. Every session takes on the unique flavor of the students, with key experiences we all share.</p>

<h2>Opening activities</h2>
<p>Although campers are studying many different languages, we are committed to fostering a single, supportive community of language learners at camp. We start every session with group activities to prepare campers for what it is like to communicate in a language other than their own.</p>

<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>Throughout the weeks of each session, themes develop that enable classes to share common experiences across the many languages we offer. For example: challenges and scavenger hunts may require classes to compete or collaborate, regardless of their language and level. A multicultural restaurant at lunchtime may require the input of all students. Past themes have included international travel and World Cup Week.</p>

<h2>Performances</h2>
<p>Some classes decide to invite parents to weekly shows highlighting skits and skills developed during the week.</p>

<h2>Closing ceremonies</h2>
<p>Every session culminates with exciting, multicultural events. Some recent favorites: an international art heist, the Linguistic Iron Chef Challenge, and LinguaZone Olympics.</p>
