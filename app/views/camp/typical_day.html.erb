<h1>A typical day at LZ Camp</h1>
<p>Make no mistake about it: LinguaZone Language Camp is a <em>camp</em>, and we sure do act like one! Our days are a balance of focus and fun, helping students accomplish an incredible amount without feeling like "summer school."</p>

<h2>8:15 - 8:30 Arriving</h2>
<p>Students arrive between 8:15 and 8:30 to settle in before the day officially begins.</p>

<h2>8:30 - 11:30 Mornings</h2>
<p>We delve into brand new topics every morning. Through our activity-based approach, students acquire new skills and build a strong vocabulary base, reaching toward greater proficiency in the target language.</p>

<h2>11:30 - 12:30 Multi-Lingual Lunch</h2>
<p>All students enjoy a brown bag lunch together, followed by language games. Some favorites include LinguaZone Scribblish, Late Worker, Taboo, and Human Memory Board, to name a few.</p>

<h2>12:30 - 3:30 Afternoons</h2>
<p>We slow the pace in the afternoons to practice all of the new material we learn in the mornings. This dedicated time gives us the opportunity to take on elaborate, long-term projects, develop new talents, and collaborate with other classes in games and competitions.</p>

<h2>3:35 Pick-up</h2>
<p>Students call it a day and head home at 3:35.</p>
