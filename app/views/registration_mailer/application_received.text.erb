**Placing your child in the right class**
The application process is not finished just yet. We need your help to make sure we place your child in the appropriate classes.
Please take a moment to complete the _Emergency Info form_ and the _teacher recommendation form_. Both forms are located on your homepage when you login to LZAcademy.com, and they should only take a few minutes to complete. If you have any questions, please let us know.

Once we have these forms on file, we will follow up with additional details regarding your application.
many thanks,
