<h2>Engaging, activity-based curricula</h2>

	<%= image_tag "about/index/older.jpg", :class => "float_left example" %>
	<p>We specialize in hands-on, activity-based programs in all that we do. Our curricula create great summertime memories and teach lasting lessons by giving context to the learning that takes place in our classes. Campers engage in these activities using the languages they study, creating opportunities to communicate in authentic situations. The direction of the activities comes from the interests and makeup of the students in each class and are never set in stone ahead of time.</p>

<h2>Travel abroad opportunities</h2>
<p>Campers and their families have the opportunity to join their teacher on a trip abroad to put their language skills to use among native speakers. Trips are professionally designed for students and their families in conjunction with Casterbridge Tours. We take care of everything from airfare to the daily itinerary to local travel and lodging accomodations. Trips average 8 - 10 days  after the conclusion of camp in August.</p>
